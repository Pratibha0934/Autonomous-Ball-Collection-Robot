# Autonomous-ball-collecting-robot

The project involves creating an autonomous ball-collecting robot that uses ultrasonic sensors and servo motors for navigation and collection.
The robot is equipped with a servo motor arm and four motor-driven wheels, allowing it to move in any direction. 
The ultrasonic sensor detects the distance to the nearest ball and guides the robot towards it. If the ball is within a certain range, the robot moves forward, stops when close enough, and then activates the servo motor to collect the ball. 
If no ball is detected, the robot enters a search mode, rotating in place to locate another ball.
The project is coded in Arduino, ensuring precise control of the motors and servo for efficient ball collection.
